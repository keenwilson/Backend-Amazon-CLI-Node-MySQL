# Bamazon-Nodejs-MySQL
 Create an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL and Node.js that will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory

## How this App Works

* This app utilized `MySQL` to create a product list that displays to users. 

* When user wants to buy an item, the database updates the amount and shows the user the purchase order costs. 

* If there isn't enough of the product left in stock, the database doesn't fulfill the order, and tells the user.
